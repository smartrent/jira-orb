  ignore_errors:
    description: "Ignore errors. Errors posting to Atlassian will not result in failed builds unless disabled."
    type: boolean
    default: true
  state:
    description: >
      A valid Jira state for the build/deployment. If set as `unknown` (default),
      then the state will be determined by the job status as `successful` or `failed`.
      `rolled_back` is only valid for deployments.

  when:
    description: >
      The condition in which the notification should be sent. By default, the notification will always

      or separate successful reporting into a separate job that can be rerun if the Jira request fails
      without having to rerun the entire build.
    type: enum
    enum: [always, on_fail, on_success]
    default: always
  base_revision:
    description: The base revision of the build/deployment to use when detecting issue keys from commit messages.
    type: string
    default: "main"
  detect_rollback:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      Detect if the deployment is a rollback if the HEAD commit is not the same as the base revision. This would
      indicate that an older job was rerun to redeploy other changes.
    default: false
